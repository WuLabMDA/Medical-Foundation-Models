> **Abstract**: Cancer research increasingly relies on integrating diverse data modalities, from genomics to imaging. Foundation models (FMs)â€”large pretrained deep-learning modelsâ€”provide powerful new ways to discover biomarkers, enhance diagnosis, and personalize treatments. This review systematically examines multimodal integration strategies in oncology, highlighting the shift from traditional machine learning to advanced FMs. We identify state-of-the-art methods, resources, and challenges, laying essential groundwork for the next generation of large-scale AI models poised to revolutionize cancer research.

# ðŸ“– Comprehensive Multi-Modal Data Repositories

A critical foundation for advancing multimodal data integration in cancer research lies in the availability of comprehensive, high-quality data repositories. These repositories provide researchers with access to diverse data typesâ€”such as genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, imaging, and clinical metadataâ€”enabling the development and validation of sophisticated machine learning and foundation models. Table 1 presents a curated list of key multi-modal data repositories that are widely used in oncology. These resources not only support the integration of heterogeneous data but also facilitate the discovery of novel biomarkers, the classification of cancer subtypes, and the personalization of treatment strategies. By leveraging these repositories, researchers can train and validate models that capture the full complexity of cancer biology, ultimately driving the next generation of AI-powered oncology tools.
