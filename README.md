> **Abstract**: Cancer research increasingly relies on integrating diverse data modalities, from genomics to imaging. Foundation models (FMs)â€”large pretrained deep-learning modelsâ€”provide powerful new ways to discover biomarkers, enhance diagnosis, and personalize treatments. This review systematically examines multimodal integration strategies in oncology, highlighting the shift from traditional machine learning to advanced FMs. We identify state-of-the-art methods, resources, and challenges, laying essential groundwork for the next generation of large-scale AI models poised to revolutionize cancer research.

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Contributions

This review makes several key contributions to the field of multimodal data integration in oncology. We provide a comprehensive examination of integration strategies, spanning from classical machine learning techniques to emerging foundation models. By analyzing this transition, we offer insights into the evolution of computational approaches in cancer research. Our holistic view encompasses recent advancements and persistent challenges, particularly in integrating multi-omics data with advanced imaging. We identify state-of-the-art foundation models and curate a list of publicly available resources to support further research. Importantly, we argue that current integrative methods lay the essential groundwork for the next generation of large-scale AI models poised to revolutionize oncology. To our knowledge, this is the first review to systematically map this critical transition, framing it as foundational for the future of AI in cancer research.
