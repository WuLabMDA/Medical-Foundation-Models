> **Abstract**: Cancer research increasingly relies on integrating diverse data modalities, from genomics to imaging. Foundation models (FMs)â€”large pretrained deep-learning modelsâ€”provide powerful new ways to discover biomarkers, enhance diagnosis, and personalize treatments. This review systematically examines multimodal integration strategies in oncology, highlighting the shift from traditional machine learning to advanced FMs. We identify state-of-the-art methods, resources, and challenges, laying essential groundwork for the next generation of large-scale AI models poised to revolutionize cancer research.
