### ðŸ“š Taxonomy of Foundation Models in Multimodal Cancer Research

A clear conceptual map helps position existing work and guide future model design.  
Figure below groups todayâ€™s foundation models into four complementary domains:

1. **Omics FMs** â€“ large language/transformer models trained on genomic, transcriptomic, or single-cell data (e.g., MO-Net, MolFM, scGPT, GenePT, Path-GPTOmic).  
2. **Pathology FMs** â€“ vision or vision-language backbones for WSI tiles (e.g., UNI, PLUTO, CTransPath, GigaPath).  
3. **Radiology FMs** â€“ volumetric vision models for CT/MRI/PET (e.g., SAM-Med, CT-CLIP, Google CT-FM).  
4. **Cross-Domain Integrative FMs** â€“ architectures explicitly built to ingest and align two + modalities (e.g., SAM, REMEDIS).
