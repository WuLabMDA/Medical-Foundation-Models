> **Abstract**: Cancer research increasingly relies on integrating diverse data modalities, from genomics and epigenomics to radiology and digital pathology. We survey 200+ studies, chart the shift from classical machine-learning pipelines to large-scale foundation models (FMs), and outline open challenges in data harmonisation, model interpretability, and computational cost. Our goal is to provide a one-stop resource for researchers building the next generation of integrative AI systems in oncology.
